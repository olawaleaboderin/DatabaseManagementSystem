SCRIPT NAME: best_varieties_multiple_regions.sql

PURPOSE: Retrieve the top-performing varieties for a selected trait across MULTIPLE regions within a country,filtered also by crop (optional) and environmental condition.

WHAT THIS QUERY DOES:
    • Allows selection of several regions using IN (...)
    • Calculates the average trait value (e.g., grain_yield, plant_height)
    • Ranks varieties across all selected regions combined
    • Returns the best-performing varieties under a specific environment condition
    • Optional crop filtering (Maize, Sorghum, Cowpea, etc.)

USE CASES:
    • Compare variety performance across multiple target recommendation domains
    • Multi-region varietal adaptation analysis
    • National-level varietal release decision support
    • MET (Multi-Environment Trial) analysis focusing on regional clusters

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
    • The region filter uses `IN (:regions_list)` to support multiple region inputs.
    • If :crop_name IS NULL → query automatically includes all crops.
    • Aggregation uses AVG() so repeated measures or trials are averaged.
    • Results are ranked from highest to lowest.
