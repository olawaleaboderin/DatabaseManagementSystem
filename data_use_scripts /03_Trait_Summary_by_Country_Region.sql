SCRIPT : Trait Summary by Country and Region

PURPOSE:
    This query provides a broader summary of a trait across country and region,
    without breaking the results down by year or environment condition.

    It calculates:
        • Mean value
        • Minimum value
        • Maximum value
        • Variance

    This script is designed for:
        • National-level varietal performance reporting
        • Regional yield mapping
        • Policy planning and agricultural zone summaries
        • High-level dashboards that do not require year/environment granularity

PARAMETER:
    :trait_name  
        → The desired trait to summarize (e.g., 'grain_yield').

NOTES:
    • Aggregates across all years and all environments.
    • Useful for identifying regions with high or low performance.
    • Helps in resource allocation and national agricultural monitoring.
    • Can be modified to include additional filters (crop, year range, etc.)
